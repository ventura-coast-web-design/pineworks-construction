                <h2>The Pineworks Legacy</h2>
                <p>It all began in 1978 when Joe Pinewood returned from Vietnam to Maple Ridge with his grandfather's tools and a vision. He had learned the art of timber framing from his grandfather, who built barns and homes throughout the region during the Great Depression.</p>
                
                <p>With determination and skill, Joe began taking on projects in the community. His reputation grew quickly - every joint was precise, every beam was true, and he never left a job site until he was confident it would stand for generations.</p>
